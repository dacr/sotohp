# SOTOHP

A software to easily manage a huge amount of photos. Why ? Just because those past 22 years, I've taken more than 89000
photos, and more than 4600 videos. Once again this project has first started as just [a "small" script][photosc].

## Principles

1. The photos referential is always your photos directories as you've organized them
2.
